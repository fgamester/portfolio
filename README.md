# Portfolio

Hello there👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼  
This is my personal portfolio where I want to display all my projects, exercises, hobbies and more. Basically it is my blog but more formal.

It was developed in a way that I won't need to update the code if i want to add content, this is because all the content is fetched from a Gist on GitHub. The portfolio reads that information and displays it. Obviusly, if i want to add more sections i will need to improve the project, but for adding posts, it won´t be necesary.

### Used Technologies:  
**-React:** The JavaScript library that speeds up Frontend coding unifying HTML and JavaScript through its component format.

**-TypeScript:** A programming language extended from JavaScript, allowing for more control over variables and data types.

**-TailwindCSS:** A CSS framework that provides a combination of classes (like Bootstrap) and custom CSS properties, with the particularity that we can compile it to create a customized stylesheet with only the necesary styles, considerably decreasing our project's weight for its deployment/production.

## You want to try it?

### Get the repository to your local workspace

First of all you need to clone the repository :
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fgamester/portfolio.git
```
Then run the packages installation command:
```bash
$ npm install
```
And finally run the server locally with the following command:
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
The project will be running at the 5173 port by default, so you will need to type [`localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173) on your web browser or click the marked link. If port 5173 is already in use, the command will use the next available port, such as 5174, and so on.
